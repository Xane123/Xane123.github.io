					<p>Xane might not be active nowadays, but he has accounts on a lot of websites, which usually showcase his creations. Here are the accounts that have been found so far.</p>
					<p>If a website's name has a link/chain emoji (🔗) after it, the main link is on <code>thex.site</code>, and may break if Xane loses this domain name. Right-click or long tap this emoji to copy an alternaitve link to the site, which might not break in that scenario.</p>
					<h1>Personal</h1>
					<p>These websites are more personal to Xane, either made by him (like the website you're on) or written by him. Although you might expect to see his social media accounts here, those weren't considered "personal" enough for this list. Xane mainly shares other people's content now, anyways.</p>

						<th>Name</th>

							<td><a href=https://blog.thex.site>Xane's Blog</a> (<a href=https://xanem1.blogspot.com rel=nofollow>🔗</a>)</td>

						</tr>

							<td><a href=https://www.gsite.thex.site>The X Site on Google Sites (<a href=https://sites.google.com/view/xanem1 rel=nofollow>🔗</a>)</a></td>

						</tr>

					<h1>Art</h1>
					<p>While Xane somewhat wishes he could be an artist, his mind has annoyed him with fake itches that it can start creating within split-seconds for most of his life, keeping him from focusing or concentrating on more important tasks like drawing lines for art. Despite how this limitation is holding him back, he has signed up to a couple art-related websites to show the few pieces he <i>somehow</i> made when his mind wasn't bugging him too much.</p>

							<a href=https://artfight.net/~Xane_MM rel=nofollow>Art Fight</a></td>
							<td>Though he didn't compete in 2020's battle due to his mind stopping him (as usual), Xane's on Art Fight with one character, Susan, available to draw if you'd like!</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><a href=https://artbreeder.com/xane_mm>Artbreeder</a></td>
							<td>When it was first released, <i>Artbreeder</i> showed what AI could generate (with its training data). Xane generated some interesting and sometimes <b>outright gore-filled</b> images using its first tool, <b>Splicer</b>, and has continued to try out and generate imagery using its more recent tools, his favorites being <b>Splicer2</b> and <b>Prompter</b>. Xane doesn't like how AI is mostly ruining the internet, but he enjoys experimenting with AI images here.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><a href=https://deepdreamgenerator.com/u/xane123>Deep Dream Generator</a></td>
							<td>Xane can also be found on Deep Dream Generator. He used this website before Artbreeder, interested in the then-new trippy <b>Deep Dream</b> and somewhat artistic <b>Deep Style</b> "tools", running his own photos through them, admiring the mix of strange and interesting images that came from these experiments. Deep Dream Generator has added more models (including modern prompt-based generators), but Xane mostly sticks to the original duo. He has tried upscaling photos and generating a few Studio Ghibli-styled images of <a href=https://deepdreamgenerator.com/ddream/hp5awmnmc95>Mary</a> and Mary's medium restaurant cup, though.</td>

							<td>Xane is on the Doomworld Forums. He attempted to post about Magical Mary there back when it was called "World of Kirbycraft", but everyone shot it down. He doesn't post there anymore, but still uses his account to like other users' posts. It's unknown if anyone would give Magical Mary a second chance on these forums.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><a href=https://forum.zdoom.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=17748>ZDoom Forums</a></td>
							<td>As Xane has used ZDoom and GZDoom for years over any other Doom source port family, he's been on their forums since 2015. Due to their more recent attempts to improve their security, he's almost locked out of his account, as he won't know any of the information that they would require to verify who he is.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><a href=http://www.digitalmzx.net/forums/index.php?showuser=2507>DigitalMZX</a></td>
							<td>Years ago, Xane attempted to develop games using MegaZeux, so he used the DigitalMZX forums to talk to others and to upload his iffy "engines" to the vault. The only game he finished was BamBam's Adventure, an iffy game that mainly used built-in enemies and had big gameplay flaws.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><a href=https://www.belltreeforums.com/members/xane_mm.133497>The Bell Tree</a></td>
							<td>Xane played Animal Crossing: New Horizons online somwtimes in 2020, so he signed up to these forums to help him trade and talk about the game. He hasn't interacted with the forum since then…

					<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
					<p>Any websites that don't fit into any of the previous sections are listed here.</p>
					<table>
						<th>Name</th>
						<th>Description</th>
						<tr>
							<td><a href=https://www.youtube.com/user/XaneCorpProductions>YouTube</a></td>
							<td>Xane's YouTube channel. Most videos were made private when a flawed US law, COPPA, was updated, though some have become public again since.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><a href=https://Xane123.redbubble.com>Redbubble</a></td>
							<td>Xane's main way of supporting him. His Redbubble store has designs based on things in Magical Mary's world and his best photographs, with many products to put them on! The "Mary air dashing" art is the only art not made by him; It was drawn by Setenza, who gave him permission to sell this specific image.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><a href=https://audius.co/xane_mma>Audius</a></td>
							<td>An up-to-date collection of Xane's music, including Magical Mary's soundtrack.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><a href=https://soundcloud.com/xane-myers rel=nofollow>Soundcloud</a></td>
							<td>Xane's Soundcloud, the website where all of Xane's used to be uploaded and kept up to date. Due to changes to Soundcloud's plans, Xane no longer has Pro, so songs here are most likely outdated versions. Audius (and even VK) are better options for hearing Xnae's music.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><a href=https://www.tinkercad.com/users/bcxD3s8lpwG-xane-myers>Tinkercad</a></td>
							<td>Xane used to use Tinkercad to make 3D models for <a href=https://magicalmary.thex.site>Magical Mary</a> using the online Autodesk service Tinkercad. Despite it only supporting colors, he managed to make decent models using it, which could then be used for pre-rendered images like first-person weapon sprites. As he has moved on to using Blender for more detailed and higher quality modeling, you may tinker with, download, or even 3D print any of his public models here!</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><a href=https://sketchfab.com/Xane_MM>Sketchfab</a></td>
							<td>If you only want to take a look at Xane's many 3D models, the best place to do so is at Sketchfab! Here, all of his notable 3D models, from his Tinkercad creations that attempted to push its limits, to his less-limited Blender models, which also showcase his attention to detail (and odd obsession with disposable cups).</td>
