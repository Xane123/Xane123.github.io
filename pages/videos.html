					<p>Years ago, Xane got a laptop with Windows Vista on it, which had Windows Movie Maker and DVD Maker on it. This gave him the idea to try burning his own DVDs using odd things such as messed-up Sims videos, footage from his capture card, and even at one point his laptop's built-in webcam!</p>
					<p>While Xane was proud of these DVDs years ago, he now looks back on them with mixed feelings. They aren't really that good, but some of them probably helped Xane improve and led to later projects; For example, World of Kirbycraft led to <a href="pages/mma/index.html">Mary's Magical Adventure</a> being created, which was at one point a game based on the movie's characters.</p>
					<p>Most people would leave these old DVDs on a shelf to gather dust or outright get rid of them, but Xane feels the internet should see how it all began, back in ~2008, up until 2011. Therefore, any DVDs Xane finds that were made by him only will be viewable here. This isn't <b>YouXaneTube</b>, but that part of Xane.com didn't have a chance of competing with YouTube.</p>
					<p>The movies listed here are in chronological order.<!-- If you want to read about these movies elsewhere, you can do so on <a href="https://worldofkirbycraft.miraheze.org/wiki/Movies">Xane Wiki</a>.--></p>
