			<div class="content">
				<p>This game is in its alpha development part, but you can play and try out the game now! If you're on Windows (pre-compiled builds are 32-bit), MacOS, or Ubuntu/a compatible Linux variant, click its logo below to download its compiled executable. Also, don't forget to download the game data below that. Once both are downloaded, extract both to the same directory then run the executable named "MagicalMary".</p>
				<p>If you're on a variant of Linux that isn't based on Ubuntu or a derivative or just want to compile the source yourself, click the box below, find the source link, then clone/fork the repository or download it as a ZIP, then compile using <a rel=nofollow href=https://zdoom.org/wiki/Compile_GZDoom_on_Linux>the instructions found on ZDoom's wiki</a>. Don't forget to move the game data to the compiled app's folder after it compiles!</p>
				<details><summary>Info about security warnings</summary>
					<p>Magical Mary: Redthorn's Family Ransom is not well-known and doesn't have a security certificate to sign officially-released executable files with. Also, anti-viruses are quick to declare unpopular apps as viruses without second thought, so this section will tell you the possible problems you may encounter when initially getting Magical Mary: Redthorn's Family Ransom to run.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If you're using Norton, it may detect this game as a virus named WS.Reputation1. If it does, tell it to restore the game's executable file, as that is a made-up virus that only exists due to low reputation in the Norton community. This game is not popular, so it will not have a good reputation. Viruses would never be sneaked into this game, which you can verify by uploading the engine files to VirusTotal or a similar website.</li>
						<li>On Windows, SmartScreen will warn you about the app/program not having a publisher when you first run it. If you're greeted with a dialog that tells you about an "unknown publisher", click "more info" then "Run anyway".</li>
						<li>If MacOS's Gatekeeper prevents the game from running, temporarily disable it in System Preferences. You may need to use Terminal commands just to bypass it on the app file! It's probably best to just set up Bootcamp and run the Windows version in it, or boot a Linux distro.</li>
					</ul>
