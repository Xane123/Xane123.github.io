				<p>This game is in its alpha development part, but you can play and try out the game now! If you're on Windows (pre-compiled builds are 32-bit), MacOS, or Ubuntu/a compatible Linux variant, click its logo below to download its compiled executable. Also, don't forget to download the game data below that. Once both are downloaded, extract both to the same directory then run the executable named "MagicalMary".</p>
				<p>If you're on a variant of Linux that isn't based on Ubuntu or a derivative or just want to compile the source yourself, click the box below, find the source link, then clone/fork the repository or download it as a ZIP, then compile using <a rel=nofollow href=https://zdoom.org/wiki/Compile_GZDoom_on_Linux>the instructions found on ZDoom's wiki</a>. Don't forget to move the game data to the compiled app's folder after it compiles!</p>
				<details><summary>Info about security warnings</summary>
					<p>Magical Mary 1: Redthorn's Family Ransom is not well-known and doesn't have a security certificate to sign officially-released executable files with. Also, anti-viruses are quick to declare unpopular apps as viruses without second thought, so this section will tell you the possible problems you may encounter when initially getting Magical Mary 1: Redthorn's Family Ransom to run.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If you're using Norton, it may detect this game as a virus named WS.Reputation1. If it does, tell it to restore the game's executable file, as that is a made-up virus that only exists due to low reputation in the Norton community. This game is not popular, so it will not have a good reputation. Viruses would never be sneaked into this game, which you can verify by uploading the engine files to VirusTotal or a similar website.</li>
						<li>On Windows, SmartScreen will warn you about the app/program not having a publisher when you first run it. If you're greeted with a dialog that tells you about an "unknown publisher", click "more info" then "Run anyway".</li>
						<li>If MacOS's Gatekeeper prevents the game from running, temporarily disable it in System Preferences. You may need to use Terminal commands just to bypass it on the app file! It's probably best to just set up Bootcamp and run the Windows version in it, or boot a Linux distro.</li>
					</ul>

			<div class="content">
				<p>This game requires game data to function. Please download the latest version of it then extract this to the game's folder. Remember, this is an alpha build, so it is <u>not</u> representive of the final product, which will be released <i>years</i> from now.</p>
				<h1>Free</h1>
				<p>For now, until Magical Mary 1: Redthorn's Family Ransom gains any popularity or interest, it will remain completely free to download the latest good version game data. If a Patreon campaign is started, the build downloadable here will always be one upload behind it.</p>
				<a class="button" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/mary-game-1/downloads/public/game-data.zip">Download</a>
				<h1>Patreon?</h1>
				<p>There's no current plans to set up a Patreon campaign for things Xane makes (random videos, AND this game), but if one is created, the free download here will always be at least one step behind the latest, which only patrons would be able to download first.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<p>Magical Mary 1: Redthorn's Family Ransom accepts optional downloads developed by Xane which add or change things in-game! Click/tap the picture beside the mod you want to download.</p>
				<p>If a mod doesn't work correctly, re-download the game data and the mods. Make sure the mod is in the same folder as the game data and application, too! It will automatically load any official mods placed in the game directory.</p>
				<p>If you still have the Materials Mod (mod_materials.pk3), please delete it as the game will not notice it in more recent versions. Instead, that mod has been integrated into the game. If your system can't handle reflective surfaces or slows down trying to render them, bring down the console with <b>~</b> then type this command:</p>
				<p><code>gl_materials 0</code></p>
