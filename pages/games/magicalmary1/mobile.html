				<p>Although Magical Mary: Redthorn's Family Ransom is designed to be played on a computer, you can play it on Android. It requires more steps and a single app purchase, however; Follow these instructions to play MMA on the go:</p>
				<details>
					<summary>How to Setup Magical Mary: Redthorn's Family Ransom on Android</summary>
					<ul>
						<li class=step><img src=https://i.imgur.com/rNIEmavb.jpg class="inline-left"/>Visit Google Play and search for Delta Touch by Open Touch Games, which costs $3.49. After purchasing it, install it on your mobile device.</li>
						<li class=step><img src=https://i.imgur.com/3xATID4b.jpg class="inline-left"/>Open Delta Touch and use the arrow in the upper-right corner of the screen to switch to <b>GZDoom v3.3pre</b>.</li>
						<li class=step>Download the game data from the link below along with the mobile mod, which tweaks things for touch controls and lower-end mobile devices.</li>
						<li class=step>Once those are downloaded, use a file manager app to extract the files from both ZIP files. (In FX, you have to select each file in each ZIP file then choose "Download" from the upper-right menu.)</li>
						<li class=step><img src=https://i.imgur.com/qKzbuR9b.jpg class="inline-left"/>If prompted for a location to extract to, choose SD card/OpenTouch/Delta/mods. If the last folder doesn't exist, create it. (In FX, select all of the files that were "downloaded" to the Downloads folder, choose "cut" at the top of the screen", then navigate to the aforementioned "mods" folder.)</li>
						<li class=step><img src=https://i.imgur.com/vRq3SWRt.png class="inline-left"/>Return to Delta Touch. Tap "Freedoom: Phase 2" from the IWAD list, then tap the keyboard button at the bottom right corner of the screen.</li>
						<li class=step>A dialog box will appear. Tap the three-line button then select the game data files in any order, as long as <b>mma_data.pk3</b> comes before the others.</li>
						<li class=step>Exit the dialog box then tap the play button in the lower-right corner. You'll have to pass the Google Play license check, download Freedoom: Phase 2, and download 70 megabytes of soundfonts, the last one not mattering for now unless a MIDI soundtrack is ever added. Allow all of those, tapping the play button after each is finished. Connect to Wi-Fi if on a limited data plan.</li>
						<li class=step>After those files all download, tap the play button again. You should see Mary drinking from a restaurant cup then the Xane Corp. logo should appear if everything was done correctly. If Freedoom: Phase 2's title screen appears instead of the Xane Corp. logo, stop the game then re-select the game data/mods again using the three-line button as before.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>After this, it's up to you to configure the touch controls and ZDoom settings. Some settings need to be changed to the different defaults the computer version uses for consistency, but that might not be important. Just please remember to never crouch! GZDoom's default crouching really breaks the game, unlike recent modifications.</p>

				<p>This game requires game data to function. Please download the latest version of it below.</p>
				<h1>Free</h1>
				<p>For now, until Magical Mary: Redthorn's Family Ransom gains any popularity or interest, it will remain completely free to download the absolute latest test version game data (which is <b><u>not</u></b> representive of the final game). If a Patreon campaign is started, the build downloadable here will always be one upload behind it, which will only cost $2 per month. If any problems would occur, such as the game not starting due to changed files compared to the executable, Xane will make an exception and give out the otherwise Patreon-exclusive game data early.</p>
