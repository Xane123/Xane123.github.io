		<h1>About Xane</h1>
		<img alt="Picture of Xane tinted blue looking to the right of the picture." title="Picture of Xane." class="inline-left" src=https://i.imgur.com/OwoarS2b.png />
		<p>Xane is a self-called "computer whiz" who stays up through the night, sometimes making his game, Mary's Magical Adventure.</p>
		<p>Xane has compulsive behaviors and other disorders, which sometimes force itches and diziness to start when there's no reason for them.</p>
		<p>If you'd like to support Xane, you can send Monero to wallet address <code>4522bqvwUF2RBkARVP5hZpWnXaynh4PQEHFy63cBqUTMdB1goag6deuUgUWjCNubdnjmPFNzNZg9AaYq5gRvGP7u7mQDSSe</code> or buy products from his shop on Shapeways, <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/shops/the-x-shop">the X Shop</a>. Xane has no Patreon or other way of support yet as he isn't popular enough for it to work yet.</p>
