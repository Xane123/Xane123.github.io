Aim the camera and push the Snapper Button. If it falls asleep, push the button, known as the Sleep Button.<br>
<br>
If there isn't the amount of film you payed for, then push the camera closed, and I will refund your money.<br>
When you take a picture, if it turns out bad, I'm not refunding money!

When you take a picture, if it turns out bad, I'm not refunding money! There's a definite chance that this one will fail if I have less thn 3 pix remaining in the current pack. The expected amount remaining (total) will be shown at the top of the screen (page).<br>

<h1>The Amount Suspected MayBe Wrong!</h1>
The amount remaining is one big guess. You never know if the film currently in is one big dud...
