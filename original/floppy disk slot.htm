The Floppy Disk Slot<br>
<br>
The Floppy Disk Slot is a very neat floppy disk slot, though you can't use it. You can, but then, it will mess up on you...<br>
If pushing the side button (<image src="floppy.bmp">) dosen't eject it, then you'll need two people and their fingernails. Refer to<br>
the troubleshooting section for the procedure and other notices...</a>
