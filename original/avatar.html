<br>
A funny man. He speaks to animals of any type, and is very harsh to <a href="#Katara">Katara</a>. Toph reffers to him as &quot<a href="www.shushybye.com.htm#a">Snoozles</a>&quot.<br>
<br>
<a name=Katara>Katara<br>

Katara knows waterbending when she sees it. She is still learnin now, and is teaching <a href="#Aang">Aang</a> it as well. When Toph joins their team, then her and Toph usually get in lots of fights! (That is crazy).
